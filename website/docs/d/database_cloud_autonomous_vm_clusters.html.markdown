# Data Source: oci_database_cloud_autonomous_vm_clusters
This data source provides the list of Cloud Autonomous Vm Clusters in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets a list of the Autonomous cloud VM clusters in the specified compartment.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_cloud_autonomous_vm_clusters" "test_cloud_autonomous_vm_clusters" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	availability_domain = var.cloud_autonomous_vm_cluster_availability_domain
	cloud_exadata_infrastructure_id = oci_database_cloud_exadata_infrastructure.test_cloud_exadata_infrastructure.id
	display_name = var.cloud_autonomous_vm_cluster_display_name
	state = var.cloud_autonomous_vm_cluster_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_domain` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given availability domain exactly.
* `cloud_exadata_infrastructure_id` - (Optional) If provided, filters the results for the specified cloud Exadata infrastructure.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The compartment [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given. The match is not case sensitive.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given lifecycle state exactly.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `cloud_autonomous_vm_clusters` - The list of cloud_autonomous_vm_clusters.

### CloudAutonomousVmCluster Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `availability_domain` - The name of the availability domain that the cloud Autonomous VM cluster is located in.
* `cloud_exadata_infrastructure_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the cloud Exadata infrastructure.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `cpu_core_count` - The number of CPU cores enabled on the cloud Autonomous VM cluster.
* `data_storage_size_in_gb` - The total data storage allocated, in gigabytes (GB).
* `data_storage_size_in_tbs` - The total data storage allocated, in terabytes (TB).
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `description` - User defined description of the cloud Autonomous VM cluster.
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name for the cloud Autonomous VM cluster. The name does not need to be unique.
* `domain` - The domain name for the cloud Autonomous VM cluster.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `hostname` - The hostname for the cloud Autonomous VM cluster.
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Cloud Autonomous VM cluster.
* `last_maintenance_run_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last maintenance run.
* `last_update_history_entry_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last maintenance update history. This value is updated when a maintenance update starts.
* `license_model` - The Oracle license model that applies to the Oracle Autonomous Database. Bring your own license (BYOL) allows you to apply your current on-premises Oracle software licenses to equivalent, highly automated Oracle PaaS and IaaS services in the cloud. License Included allows you to subscribe to new Oracle Database software licenses and the Database service. Note that when provisioning an Autonomous Database on [dedicated Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/adbddoverview.htm), this attribute must be null because the attribute is already set at the Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure level. When using [shared Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm#AEI), if a value is not specified, the system will supply the value of `BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE`. 
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `memory_size_in_gbs` - The memory allocated in GBs.
* `next_maintenance_run_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the next maintenance run.
* `node_count` - The number of database servers in the cloud VM cluster. 
* `nsg_ids` - A list of the [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network security groups (NSGs) that this resource belongs to. Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see [Security Rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm). **NsgIds restrictions:**
	* Autonomous Databases with private access require at least 1 Network Security Group (NSG). The nsgIds array cannot be empty. 
* `ocpu_count` - The number of CPU cores enabled on the cloud Autonomous VM cluster. Only 1 decimal place is allowed for the fractional part.
* `shape` - The model name of the Exadata hardware running the cloud Autonomous VM cluster. 
* `state` - The current state of the cloud Autonomous VM cluster.
* `subnet_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet the cloud Autonomous VM Cluster is associated with.

	**Subnet Restrictions:**
	* For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node RAC DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.

	These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and backup subnet. 
* `time_created` - The date and time that the cloud Autonomous VM cluster was created.
* `time_updated` - The last date and time that the cloud Autonomous VM cluster was updated.
